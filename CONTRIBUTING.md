# Contributing to rettle
First off, thanks for wanting to contribute to this project!

This has been a passion project over many evenings and weekends to bring the community a simplified ETL abstraction that anyone can drop into their projects for data processing needs. With that in mind, **PLEASE** abide by these principles:   
- Try not to introduce too much complexity in how people interact with this crate.
- Try as much as possible not to diminish the *kettle* analogy or the overall abstraction that has been put in place.
- Look to Ingredient crates (linked to in `README.md` or in community) for *inspiration* as to how I imagine people to use and support this crate.

## License
This project uses the MIT or Apache-2 license, so contributors to this project MUST agree to their terms and conditions to be able to submit or request changes in this project.

## Tickets
Before opening up a new Ticket, please follow these simple rules:  
- Check to see if there is already an existing Issue Ticket that describes the Enhancement, Feature, or Bug that you would like to share.
- If there is a similar Issue but it doesn't quite address the idea/problem you are reporting, add a comment first to see if that Ticket can be expanded or if a separate Ticket needs to be created.
- For opening Bug Tickets, please include the following:
  - Title that captures the problem identified, starting with `[Bug]`
  - Clear description of the problem, which as much information as you can provide
  - Steps to reproduce the problem
  - Screenshot of the Log outputs or compiler errors

## Pull Requests
Whenever possible, please include Tests to keep the code coverage as high as possible and to prevent future changes from breaking your new features. Also, help keep the doc comments up-to-date to continue making this project as accessible as possible to people using the crate and those contributing to it.

Happy contributing and welcome to the rettle Team!
